  aboutme: `
  Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Swabian machine learning student in the beautiful city of TÃ¼bingen, right in the heart of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. While I've always had a broad interest in computer science, my passion is now clearly on machine learning. I'm especially fascinated by reinforcement learning and robotics, and I am currently working on these topics as a research assistant.
  \n If you want to know more about me, feel free to check out my projects or reach out via email!`,
